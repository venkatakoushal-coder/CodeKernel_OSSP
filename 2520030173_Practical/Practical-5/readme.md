## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

### 1. Producer–Consumer using Anonymous Pipe

- **Parent Process = Producer** → generates and sends data.
- **Child Process = Consumer** → receives and consumes the data.
- `pipe()` → creates an anonymous pipe for communication between processes.
- `fork()` → creates the child process.
- `write()` → producer sends data through the pipe.
- `read()` → consumer receives data from the pipe.
- The pipe provides communication between the parent and child processes.

### 2. Implementing `ls | grep ".c"`

- This program implements the shell command `ls | grep ".c"` using system calls.
- `fork()` → creates child processes for executing the commands.
- `pipe()` → creates a communication channel between the processes.
- `dup2()` → redirects the standard input/output to the pipe.
- `execlp()` / `exec*()` → replaces the child process with the required commands such as `ls` and `grep`.
- The output of `ls` is passed through the pipe as input to `grep`.

### 3. Communication Efficiency

Communication efficiency is calculated using the number of items processed and the time taken for communication.

**Formula:**

```text
Communication Efficiency = Number of Items / Communication Time
