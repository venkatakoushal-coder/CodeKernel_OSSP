# OS Lab – FIFO and POSIX Signals

## Named Pipes (FIFO) and their uses:-

- `mkfifo()` – Creates a named pipe for communication between processes.
- `open()` – Opens the FIFO for reading or writing.
- `read()` – Reads messages from the FIFO.
- `write()` – Sends messages through the FIFO.
- `fork()` – Creates a new process to handle multiple clients.
- `unlink()` – Removes the FIFO after communication is completed.

## POSIX Signals and their uses:-

- `SIGINT` – Interrupts the running process, usually using Ctrl+C.
- `SIGTERM` – Requests the process to terminate.
- `SIGUSR1` – Used for sending a user-defined signal to a process.
- `signal()` – Registers a signal handler for a specific signal.
- `Signal Handler` – Handles the signal when it is received asynchronously.
- `kill()` – Sends a signal to another process using its process ID.
