## Process Synchronization

### 1. wait()

- `wait()` makes the parent process wait until any one of its child processes finishes.
- It is used to synchronize the execution of parent and child processes.
- It also allows the parent to collect the child's exit status.
- This prevents the terminated child from remaining as a zombie process.

### 2. waitpid()

- `waitpid()` allows the parent process to wait for a specific child process.
- It provides more control than `wait()`.
- The parent can specify which child process it wants to wait for.
- It can also be used to collect the child's exit status and remove the zombie process.

### 3. Zombie Process

- A zombie process is a child process that has finished execution, but its parent has not yet collected its exit status.
- The terminated child remains as an entry in the process table.
- The zombie process does not continue executing, but its process entry is still maintained.
- `wait()` or `waitpid()` can be used by the parent to collect the exit status and remove the zombie.

### 4. Process Table

- The process table is a data structure maintained by the operating system to store information about running and terminated processes.
- It contains important information such as the Process ID (PID), process state, and other process-related details.
- When a child process terminates, its entry may remain in the process table as a zombie until the parent collects its exit status.
- `wait()` or `waitpid()` allows the operating system to remove the zombie's process table entry.
